**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Database:** PostgreSQL with Orthodontic Business Schema  
**Time Zone:** Central Time (UTC-6)

## üìã Query Standards

### **Time Zone Conversion Standard**
```sql
-- Always convert UTC timestamps to Central Time for business analysis
-- Use this pattern for all time-based queries
SELECT 
  column_name AT TIME ZONE 'UTC' AT TIME ZONE 'America/Chicago' as central_time
FROM table_name;
```

### **Critical Column Usage**
```sql
-- ‚úÖ CORRECT: Use submitted_at for order timing analysis
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE submitted_at >= '2024-01-01'::timestamptz;

-- ‚ùå INCORRECT: Do not use created_at for business timing
-- SELECT * FROM orders WHERE created_at >= '2024-01-01'::timestamptz;
```

## üì¶ ORDERS & COMMERCE QUERIES

### **Monthly Revenue Analysis (Central Time)**
```sql
-- Revenue trends with proper time zone conversion

## üîç QUERY OPTIMIZATION GUIDELINES

### **Performance Best Practices**

1. **Time Range Filtering**
```sql
-- Always limit time ranges for performance
WHERE submitted_at >= (NOW() - INTERVAL '12 months')
```

2. **Index Usage**
```sql
-- Leverage existing indexes for optimal performance
-- orders: idx_orders_submitted, idx_orders_status
-- cases: idx_cases_complexity, idx_cases_status
-- tasks: idx_tasks_status, idx_tasks_assigned_to
```

3. **Proper Joins**
```sql
-- Use appropriate join types based on data relationships
LEFT JOIN for optional relationships
INNER JOIN for required relationships
```

4. **Aggregation Efficiency**
```sql
-- Use CASE WHEN for conditional aggregations
COUNT(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 END) as conditional_count
```

### **Common Query Patterns**

**Time-Based Aggregation:**
```sql
DATE_TRUNC('month', timestamp_column AT TIME ZONE 'UTC' AT TIME ZONE 'America/Chicago')
```

**Business Hours Filter:**
```sql
WHERE EXTRACT(HOUR FROM (timestamp_column AT TIME ZONE 'UTC' AT TIME ZONE 'America/Chicago')) BETWEEN 8 AND 17
  AND EXTRACT(DOW FROM (timestamp_column AT TIME ZONE 'UTC' AT TIME ZONE 'America/Chicago')) BETWEEN 1 AND 5
```

**Treatment Duration Analysis:**
```sql
EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (end_timestamp - start_timestamp))/3600 as duration_hours
```
