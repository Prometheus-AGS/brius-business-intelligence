## 🔍 Implementation Details

### **Business Intelligence Agent Enhancements**

**Enhanced Capabilities:**
```typescript
// Key prompt additions include:
- Time-aware analysis with Central Time zone conversion
- Four core domain expertise (Orders, Operations, Clinical, Customer Service)
- Database schema intelligence with submitted_at vs created_at logic
- Orthodontic treatment cycle awareness (6-12 months)
- Business hours intelligence (8 AM - 6 PM Central Time)
- Seasonal pattern recognition for orthodontic practices
```

**Critical Database Usage:**
- ✅ **CORRECT:** Uses `orders.submitted_at` for business timing analysis

```typescript
// Enhanced escalation criteria:
✅ Handle Directly:
- "What is the Brava System and how does it work?"
- "How long does typical Brius treatment take?"
- "What's the status of order #BR-2024-001?"

🔄 Escalate to BI Agent:
- Revenue analysis across multiple time periods
- Technician performance and productivity metrics
- Treatment outcome analysis and success rates
- Patient satisfaction trends and sentiment analysis
```

## 📊 Four Core Analysis Domains

### **1. 📦 Orders & Commerce**
**Database Tables:** `orders`, `payments`, `purchases`, `shipments`
**Key Metrics:** Revenue trends, order lifecycle, payment processing efficiency
**Critical Logic:** Always use `orders.submitted_at` for business timing analysis

**Example Analysis:**
```sql
-- Monthly revenue with Central Time conversion
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('month', submitted_at AT TIME ZONE 'UTC' AT TIME ZONE 'America/Chicago') as month_central,
  SUM(amount) as total_revenue,
  COUNT(*) as order_count
FROM orders 
WHERE submitted_at >= (NOW() - INTERVAL '12 months')
  AND deleted = false;
```

### **2. ⚙️ Operations**
**Database Tables:** `technicians`, `tasks`, `templates`, `team_communications`
**Key Metrics:** Technician performance, quality scores, manufacturing efficiency
**Focus Areas:** Task completion rates, quality control, capacity planning

**Example Analysis:**
```sql
-- Technician performance with quality metrics
SELECT 
  CONCAT(t.first_name, ' ', t.last_name) as technician_name,
  tr.role_type,
  AVG(tasks.quality_score) as avg_quality_score,
  COUNT(tasks.id) as tasks_completed
FROM technicians t
JOIN technician_roles tr ON t.id = tr.technician_id
JOIN tasks ON tasks.assigned_to = t.profile_id
WHERE tasks.status = 'completed';
```

### **3. 🏥 Clinical**
**Database Tables:** `cases`, `treatment_plans`, `patients`, `doctors`, `jaws`
**Key Metrics:** Treatment outcomes, success rates, patient journey analysis
**Focus Areas:** Case complexity, treatment duration, clinical effectiveness

**Example Analysis:**
```sql
-- Treatment success rates by complexity
SELECT 
  c.complexity,
  COUNT(*) as total_cases,
  AVG(c.actual_duration_months) as avg_duration,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN c.status = 'completed' THEN 1 END) as completed_cases
FROM cases c
WHERE c.treatment_start_date >= (NOW() - INTERVAL '24 months');
```

### **4. 🎧 Customer Service**
**Database Tables:** `messages`, `case_messages`, `customer_feedback`, `treatment_discussions`
**Key Metrics:** Customer satisfaction, response efficiency, sentiment analysis
**Focus Areas:** Feedback processing, communication patterns, service quality

**Example Analysis:**
```sql
-- Customer satisfaction trends
SELECT 
  cf.feedback_type,
  COUNT(*) as feedback_count,
  AVG(CASE WHEN cf.customer_satisfied = true THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as satisfaction_rate,
  AVG(cf.response_time_hours) as avg_response_hours
FROM customer_feedback cf
WHERE cf.created_at >= (NOW() - INTERVAL '6 months');
```
