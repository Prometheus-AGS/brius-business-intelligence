## üö® CRITICAL MASTRA STREAMING FIX

**IMPLEMENTED IN ALL AGENTS:** Added prominent instruction at the beginning of all agent prompts to prevent generation stopping after tool calls:

```
üö® CRITICAL MASTRA STREAMING INSTRUCTION: After executing any tool call, you MUST continue generating a comprehensive response that interprets and explains the tool results. Never stop generation immediately after a tool call - always provide analysis, insights, and conclusions based on the tool outputs. This ensures users see the complete analysis in the stream.
```

**Dynamic Timestamp Replacement:** All `{{iso_datetime}}` template strings are now replaced with actual current timestamps using `${new Date().toISOString()}` to ensure real-time accuracy.

## üéØ Four Core Business Intelligence Domains

### 1. üì¶ ORDERS & COMMERCE

**Database Focus:** [`orders`](database-schema.md#orders), [`payments`](database-schema.md#payments), [`purchases`](database-schema.md#purchases), [`shipments`](database-schema.md#shipments)

**Key Time Column Strategy:**
- **PRIMARY:** Use [`orders.submitted_at`](database-schema.md#orders) for actual order timing analysis
- **SECONDARY:** Use [`orders.created_at`](database-schema.md#orders) only for system tracking
- **CRITICAL:** Always filter by [`orders.submitted_at`](database-schema.md#orders) for business intelligence

**Analysis Capabilities:**
```sql
-- Example: Revenue analysis using correct time column
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('month', submitted_at AT TIME ZONE 'UTC' AT TIME ZONE 'America/Chicago') as month_ct,
  COUNT(*) as orders_count,
  SUM(amount) as total_revenue,
  AVG(amount) as avg_order_value
FROM orders 
WHERE submitted_at IS NOT NULL 
  AND deleted = false
  AND submitted_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '12 months'
GROUP BY month_ct
ORDER BY month_ct DESC;
```

**Business Intelligence Focus:**
- Revenue trends and forecasting
- Order lifecycle analysis (submitted ‚Üí approved ‚Üí shipped ‚Üí delivered)
- Treatment package pricing optimization
- Payment processing and collection metrics
- Shipping and fulfillment efficiency

### 3. üè• CLINICAL

**Database Focus:** [`cases`](database-schema.md#cases), [`treatment_plans`](database-schema.md#treatment_plans), [`patients`](database-schema.md#patients), [`doctors`](database-schema.md#doctors), [`jaws`](database-schema.md#jaws)

**Clinical Intelligence:**
```sql
-- Example: Treatment complexity and outcome analysis
SELECT 
  c.complexity,
  COUNT(*) as case_count,
  AVG(c.actual_duration_months) as avg_treatment_months,
  AVG(CASE WHEN c.status = 'completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as success_rate,
  d.specialty as doctor_specialty
FROM cases c
JOIN doctors d ON c.primary_doctor_id = d.id
WHERE c.treatment_start_date >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 months'
GROUP BY c.complexity, d.specialty
ORDER BY case_count DESC;
```

**Analysis Capabilities:**
- Treatment plan effectiveness and outcomes
- Case complexity distribution and success rates
- Patient journey analysis (consultation ‚Üí retention)
- Doctor performance and specialization metrics
- Treatment duration vs complexity correlation
- Clinical protocol optimization

### 4. üéß CUSTOMER SERVICE

**Database Focus:** [`messages`](database-schema.md#messages), [`case_messages`](database-schema.md#case_messages), [`customer_feedback`](database-schema.md#customer_feedback), [`treatment_discussions`](database-schema.md#treatment_discussions)

**Sentiment and Support Analysis:**
```sql
-- Example: Customer feedback sentiment analysis
SELECT 
  cf.feedback_type,
  cf.severity,
  COUNT(*) as feedback_count,
  AVG(cf.response_time_hours) as avg_response_time,
  AVG(CASE WHEN cf.customer_satisfied THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as satisfaction_rate
FROM customer_feedback cf
