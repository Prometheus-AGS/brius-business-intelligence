# Tasks: Business Intelligence Context Enhancement

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-specify-scripts-bash/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests not explicitly requested in specification - focusing on implementation tasks

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 context but independently testable
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses US1 context but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses US1 sessions but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Type definitions before implementation
- Core infrastructure before feature implementation
- Context management before domain-specific features
- API endpoints after core logic implementation
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Type definitions within stories marked [P] can run in parallel
- Tool implementations within stories marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all type definitions for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create User Context entity in src/mastra/types/context.ts with anonymous support"
Task: "Create Analysis Session entity in src/mastra/types/context.ts"
Task: "Create Context State entity for session management in src/mastra/types/context.ts"

# Launch tool implementations for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create context management tools in src/mastra/tools/context-tools.ts"
Task: "Implement context reconstruction workflow in src/mastra/workflows/context-validation.ts"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently with both authenticated and anonymous access
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently with JWT and anonymous access ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test multi-domain integration independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test architecture evaluation independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test visualization generation independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Context management)
   - Developer B: User Story 4 (Multi-domain integration)
   - Developer C: User Story 2 (Architecture evaluation)
   - Developer D: User Story 3 (Visualization generation)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Special Considerations

### Anonymous Access Support

- JWT middleware must handle missing JWT by falling back to SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- Context entities must support anonymous user identification
- Permission system must handle anonymous access with appropriate restrictions
- Memory operations must distinguish between authenticated and anonymous sessions

### MCP Server Integration

- Supabase MCP server for database schema analysis and business data access
- Tavily MCP server for architecture best practices research
- Context passing through MCP metadata headers
- Health monitoring and failover for MCP connections

### Performance Requirements

- 95% of queries complete in <30 seconds
- 99% context passing reliability
- Support for 100+ concurrent users
- 8-hour JWT session continuity with automatic refresh

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Anonymous access using SUPABASE_ANON_KEY provides authentication fallback
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Focus on Mastra framework compliance and constitutional requirements
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: 12 tasks
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: 8 tasks
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: 8 tasks
