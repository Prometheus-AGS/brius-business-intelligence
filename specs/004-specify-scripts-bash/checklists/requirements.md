# Specification Quality Checklist: Business Intelligence Context Enhancement

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All validation criteria met

### Content Quality Analysis
- **No implementation details**: Specification focuses on business requirements without mentioning specific technologies beyond necessary context (JWT, React.js as deliverable format)
- **User value focused**: All user stories clearly articulate business value and user needs
- **Non-technical language**: Written for business stakeholders to understand
- **Complete sections**: All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are properly filled

### Requirement Completeness Analysis
- **No clarification markers**: All requirements are clear and specific
- **Testable requirements**: Each functional requirement can be independently verified
- **Measurable success criteria**: All success criteria include specific metrics and percentages
- **Technology-agnostic criteria**: Success criteria focus on user outcomes rather than technical implementation
- **Complete scenarios**: Acceptance scenarios cover all critical user flows
- **Edge cases identified**: Comprehensive list of boundary conditions and error scenarios
- **Bounded scope**: Clear distinction between what is and isn't included
- **Dependencies documented**: All external dependencies and assumptions clearly stated

### Feature Readiness Analysis
- **Clear acceptance criteria**: Each functional requirement implies testable outcomes
- **Primary flow coverage**: User scenarios address the core business intelligence enhancement needs
- **Measurable outcomes**: Success criteria provide clear targets for implementation validation
- **No implementation leakage**: Specification maintains focus on requirements without prescribing solutions

## Notes

- Specification is ready for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`)
- All critical aspects of the complex BI context enhancement feature are properly captured
- The multi-domain nature of the system (clinical, financial, operational, customer service) is well-represented
- Context and identity management requirements are clearly articulated
- Architecture evaluation needs are properly scoped for analysis
