# Feature Specification: Business Intelligence Context Enhancement

**Feature Branch**: `004-specify-scripts-bash`
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "in addition to the current plan, I need you to use the brius-supabase mcp server to review the tables in public schema that do NOT have `dispatch_` in the name and are not foreign data wrapper tables and samples of data in them to determine if the business intelligence agent is properly designed to handle complex prompts and queries involving clinical, business/finance, operations, and customer service/performance related tasks, prompts, queries, etc., including the generation of react.js artifacts to provide complex views that can be imported into other applications. determine if planner-execute is the right pattern for this complex work or i another pattern may be better using the tavily mcp server to search for best practices and options that can be implemented using mastra. also, i need a successful pattern for passing context information including the JWT for a user identity into the system, so I can properly implement the user vs global memory and knowledge base functions. We need to support this in the REST interfaces for knowledge base and memory management as well as the agent implementations. I have been getting errors passing that context into workflows that seem to mishandle it. make sure the memory tables and knowledge base tables and retrieval code handle this properly."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-23

- Q: What should be explicitly excluded from feature scope to prevent scope creep? → A: Focus on core context-aware querying and visualization; exclude advanced analytics, ML predictions, and real-time data streaming
- Q: How should JWT token expiration be handled during long analysis sessions? → A: Automatically refresh JWT tokens in background without user intervention
- Q: What format should generated React components have? → A: Self-contained components with embedded styling and minimal external dependencies, always using TSX and TypeScript
- Q: How granular should data access permissions be for the multi-domain BI system? → A: Role-based permissions with department/region filtering within each domain
- Q: What should be the recovery strategy when context information becomes corrupted during workflow execution? → A: Attempt to reconstruct context from session history and continue with user notification

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Context-Aware Business Intelligence Analysis (Priority: P1)

A business analyst needs to query complex business data across clinical, financial, operational, and customer service domains while maintaining their user identity and personal context throughout the analysis session.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that enables personalized, secure, and contextual business intelligence. Without proper context handling, users cannot access personalized insights or maintain session continuity.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by authenticating a user with JWT, submitting a complex multi-domain query (e.g., "Show me patient satisfaction scores correlated with revenue trends for my assigned regions"), and verifying that the system maintains user context throughout the analysis and returns personalized results.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a authenticated user with JWT token, **When** they submit a complex cross-domain query, **Then** the system maintains their identity context and returns analysis scoped to their permissions
2. **Given** an ongoing analysis session, **When** the user asks follow-up questions, **Then** the system retains context from previous queries and builds upon prior analysis
3. **Given** a user with specific role and department/region permissions, **When** they request sensitive data, **Then** the system filters results based on their role and assigned department/region scope

### User Story 2 - Adaptive Agent Architecture Assessment (Priority: P2)

System administrators need to evaluate whether the current planner-executor pattern is optimal for complex multi-domain analysis or if alternative patterns would better serve the business intelligence use cases.

**Why this priority**: The effectiveness of the entire BI system depends on using the optimal agent architecture pattern. This assessment ensures the system can handle complex queries efficiently and accurately.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running benchmark queries across different architectural patterns and measuring response times, accuracy, and resource utilization to determine the optimal approach.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a set of complex multi-domain queries, **When** executed using current planner-executor pattern, **Then** performance metrics and accuracy scores are recorded for comparison
2. **Given** alternative architectural patterns, **When** same queries are processed, **Then** comparative analysis shows which pattern performs better for specific query types
3. **Given** pattern evaluation results, **When** recommendations are generated, **Then** clear guidance is provided on optimal architecture for different use cases

---

### User Story 3 - Interactive Visualization Generation (Priority: P3)

Business users need to generate exportable React.js components for complex data visualizations that can be embedded into other applications and dashboards.

**Why this priority**: Visualization capabilities extend the value of BI analysis by making insights accessible and shareable across different systems and user interfaces.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by requesting a complex visualization (e.g., multi-dimensional patient outcome analysis), generating the React component artifact, and successfully importing it into a test application.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** completed data analysis, **When** user requests visualization generation, **Then** system produces exportable React component with proper data binding
2. **Given** generated React component, **When** imported into external application, **Then** visualization renders correctly with interactive capabilities
3. **Given** complex multi-dataset analysis, **When** visualization is generated, **Then** component handles data relationships and user interactions appropriately

---

### User Story 4 - Multi-Domain Data Integration (Priority: P2)

Business analysts need seamless access to integrated data across clinical operations, financial performance, operational metrics, and customer service analytics without manual data correlation.

**Why this priority**: The power of business intelligence comes from cross-domain insights. This enables comprehensive analysis that reveals relationships between different business aspects.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by querying relationships between clinical outcomes and financial performance, or operational efficiency and customer satisfaction scores.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** clinical and financial data sources, **When** analyst requests correlation analysis, **Then** system automatically joins relevant datasets and identifies meaningful relationships
2. **Given** operational and customer service metrics, **When** queried together, **Then** system provides integrated analysis showing impact relationships
3. **Given** complex multi-domain query, **When** data is retrieved, **Then** results maintain referential integrity across all domains

### Edge Cases

- What happens when automatic JWT token refresh fails during long-running analysis sessions?
- How does the system handle queries that span data domains or departments/regions the user doesn't have permission to access?
- What occurs when database connections fail during multi-step analysis workflows?
- How does the system respond when requested React component generation exceeds memory or complexity limits?
- What happens when context reconstruction from session history fails or is incomplete?
