# Research: Business Intelligence Context Enhancement

**Generated**: 2025-10-23 | **Feature**: Business Intelligence Context Enhancement

## Research Overview

This document consolidates research findings for implementing JWT-based context management, multi-domain BI analysis, and React component generation within the Mastra framework architecture.

## 1. MCP Server Context Passing Patterns

### Decision: Middleware-Based Context Injection
**Rationale**: Use Express-style middleware to inject JWT context into MCP tool calls, maintaining separation of concerns while ensuring context availability throughout the tool chain.

**Implementation Pattern**:
- JWT extraction middleware parses tokens and creates context objects
- Context objects passed as metadata to MCP tools via standardized headers
- Tools access context through consistent interface without direct JWT handling

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Direct JWT passing to each tool (rejected: tight coupling, security exposure)
- Global context store (rejected: concurrency issues, memory leaks)
- Thread-local storage (rejected: Node.js event loop complications)

## 2. JWT Token Refresh Strategies

### Decision: Proactive Background Refresh with Fallback Reconstruction
**Rationale**: Implement background token refresh 15 minutes before expiration, with session history reconstruction as fallback for failed refreshes.

**Implementation Pattern**:
- Background timer checks token expiration and refreshes proactively
- Failed refresh triggers context reconstruction from session history
- User notification for degraded functionality during reconstruction
- Graceful degradation to read-only mode if reconstruction fails

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Reactive refresh on tool failure (rejected: disrupts user experience)
- Client-side refresh management (rejected: server-side sessions need server control)
- Token extension without refresh (rejected: security implications)

## 3. React TSX Component Generation Architecture

### Decision: Template-Based Generation with Embedded Styling
**Rationale**: Use AST-based code generation with predefined component templates to ensure consistent, type-safe TSX output with embedded styles.

**Implementation Pattern**:
- Data analysis results mapped to visualization schemas
- AST builders create TypeScript interfaces and React functional components
- CSS-in-JS styling embedded to minimize external dependencies
- Generated components export both default component and type definitions

**Alternatives Considered**:
- String template interpolation (rejected: no type safety, injection risks)
- Runtime component factories (rejected: requires React runtime in consuming apps)
- Headless data-only components (rejected: increases integration complexity)

## 4. Agent Architecture Pattern Evaluation

### Decision: Hybrid Pattern with Adaptive Routing
**Rationale**: Implement pattern evaluation framework that can dynamically select between planner-executor, reactive, and streaming patterns based on query complexity and data requirements.

**Pattern Analysis**:
- **Planner-Executor**: Optimal for complex multi-step analysis requiring structured reasoning
- **Reactive Agents**: Better for real-time data updates and event-driven workflows
- **Streaming Patterns**: Ideal for large dataset processing and incremental results
- **Hybrid Approach**: Route queries to optimal pattern based on complexity scoring

**Implementation Pattern**:
- Query analysis determines complexity score and data requirements
- Pattern router selects optimal architecture based on scoring matrix
- Performance metrics collected for continuous pattern optimization
- Fallback to planner-executor for unknown query types

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single pattern enforcement (rejected: suboptimal for diverse query types)
- Manual pattern selection (rejected: requires user expertise, prone to errors)
- Round-robin pattern testing (rejected: inconsistent user experience)

## 5. Database Schema Analysis for BI Adequacy

### Decision: Automated Schema Discovery with Data Profiling
**Rationale**: Implement comprehensive schema analysis that evaluates data relationships, completeness, and business intelligence readiness across all four domains.

**Implementation Pattern**:
- MCP tools scan table structures and foreign key relationships
- Data profiling analyzes column distributions, null rates, and data quality
- Business domain mapping identifies clinical, financial, operational, and service datasets
- Gap analysis reports missing relationships or inadequate data coverage

**Analysis Framework**:
- **Structural Analysis**: Table relationships, indexing adequacy, constraint validation
- **Data Quality Assessment**: Completeness ratios, distribution analysis, outlier detection
- **Business Domain Coverage**: Mapping tables to BI domains, identifying integration points
- **Performance Evaluation**: Query pattern analysis, optimization recommendations

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Manual schema review (rejected: time-intensive, error-prone)
- Static configuration files (rejected: doesn't adapt to schema changes)
- Third-party BI tools (rejected: vendor lock-in, integration complexity)

## 6. Context Error Recovery Mechanisms

### Decision: Multi-Level Recovery with Graceful Degradation
**Rationale**: Implement layered recovery system that attempts multiple reconstruction strategies before falling back to degraded functionality.

**Recovery Strategy Hierarchy**:
1. **Primary**: Context reconstruction from in-memory session history
2. **Secondary**: Context rebuild from persistent session store
3. **Tertiary**: User permission re-derivation from JWT claims
4. **Fallback**: Read-only mode with global context only

**Implementation Pattern**:
- Session history maintained in both memory and persistent storage
- Recovery attempts progress through hierarchy until successful
- User notifications provide transparency about recovery status
- Automatic session upgrade when full context restored

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single recovery strategy (rejected: insufficient reliability)
- Complete session restart (rejected: poor user experience)
- Context-less operation (rejected: violates security requirements)

## 7. Multi-Domain Data Integration Patterns

### Decision: Federation Layer with Semantic Mapping
**Rationale**: Implement data federation layer that provides unified access to multi-domain datasets while maintaining proper security boundaries and relationships.

**Implementation Pattern**:
- Domain-specific data adapters handle individual dataset access
- Semantic mapping layer translates between domain data models
- Federation service provides unified query interface with automatic joins
- Security layer enforces role-based filtering at federation level

**Domain Integration Strategy**:
- **Clinical Domain**: Patient outcomes, treatment effectiveness, care quality metrics
- **Financial Domain**: Revenue analysis, cost tracking, payment processing metrics
- **Operational Domain**: Resource utilization, workflow efficiency, capacity planning
- **Customer Service Domain**: Satisfaction scores, support metrics, feedback analysis

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Direct multi-database queries (rejected: performance and complexity issues)
- Data warehouse ETL (rejected: real-time requirements, infrastructure overhead)
- GraphQL federation (rejected: adds complexity, learning curve)

## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1**: JWT context management and error recovery mechanisms
2. **Phase 2**: MCP server integration with context passing
3. **Phase 3**: Database schema analysis and multi-domain integration
4. **Phase 4**: Agent architecture evaluation framework
5. **Phase 5**: React TSX component generation system
