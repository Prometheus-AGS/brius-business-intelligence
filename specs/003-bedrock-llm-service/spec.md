# Feature Specification: Centralized Bedrock LLM Service

**Feature Branch**: `003-bedrock-llm-service`
**Created**: 2025-01-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "i want to ensure that we are using mastra best practices validated by the mastra mcp server, context7 mcp server, and doing web search using the tavily mcp server in the management of the bedrock llm configuration for bedrock claude 4 sonnet model and the bedrock titan v2 embeddings model. make sure this service is elegantly designed to access those models from a centralized location with the appropriate configuration langfuse monitoring of tool calls, memory retrievals, knowledge base retrievals, internal tool calling (e.g., memory tool calls to automatically store and retrieve memories), and mcp server tool calling, including logging errors"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Centralized LLM Configuration Access (Priority: P1)

Developers and agents need to access AWS Bedrock Claude 4 Sonnet and Titan v2 embeddings models through a single, centralized configuration service that follows Mastra best practices.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability that enables all other AI operations. Without centralized access, we risk configuration drift, inconsistent monitoring, and poor maintainability.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a service instance, calling both Claude 4 Sonnet for text generation and Titan v2 for embeddings, and verifying consistent configuration and successful API responses.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the Bedrock LLM service is properly configured, **When** an agent requests Claude 4 Sonnet for text generation, **Then** the service returns a properly configured model instance with monitoring enabled
2. **Given** the Bedrock LLM service is configured, **When** a component requests Titan v2 embeddings, **Then** the service returns a configured embeddings instance with proper dimensions (1024) and monitoring
3. **Given** AWS credentials are properly configured, **When** the service initializes, **Then** both models are accessible and health checks pass

### User Story 2 - Comprehensive Langfuse Monitoring (Priority: P1)

All LLM operations, tool calls, memory retrievals, knowledge base interactions, and MCP server communications must be automatically traced and monitored through Langfuse for observability and debugging.

**Why this priority**: Production AI systems require comprehensive monitoring for debugging, cost tracking, performance optimization, and compliance. This is critical for system reliability.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by executing various operations (text generation, embeddings, tool calls, memory operations) and verifying that all activities appear in Langfuse with proper context, timing, and metadata.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Langfuse monitoring is enabled, **When** Claude 4 Sonnet generates text, **Then** the operation is traced with input tokens, output tokens, latency, and cost information
2. **Given** Langfuse monitoring is active, **When** memory retrieval operations occur, **Then** the semantic search calls and results are logged with performance metrics
3. **Given** monitoring is configured, **When** tool calls are executed, **Then** all tool invocations and results are traced with execution context and error states

---

### User Story 3 - Error Handling and Circuit Breaker Pattern (Priority: P2)

The service must gracefully handle AWS Bedrock API failures, rate limits, and connectivity issues with proper error logging, retry mechanisms, and circuit breaker patterns.

**Why this priority**: AWS services can experience intermittent failures or rate limiting. Robust error handling prevents cascading failures and maintains system stability.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating various failure conditions (network errors, rate limits, invalid credentials) and verifying that the service handles them gracefully with proper logging and recovery.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** AWS Bedrock returns a rate limit error, **When** the service encounters this error, **Then** it implements exponential backoff retry logic and logs the incident to Langfuse
2. **Given** network connectivity issues occur, **When** API calls fail, **Then** the circuit breaker activates and alternative fallback behavior is triggered
3. **Given** AWS credentials are invalid, **When** the service initializes, **Then** it fails fast with clear error messages and doesn't attempt operations

---

### User Story 4 - Model-Specific Configuration Management (Priority: P2)

Different models (Claude 4 Sonnet, Titan v2) require specific configuration parameters, and the service should manage these configurations centrally while allowing per-request customization.

**Why this priority**: Each model has different capabilities, token limits, and optimal parameters. Centralized configuration prevents inconsistencies while allowing flexibility.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by configuring different parameters for each model and verifying that requests use the appropriate settings while allowing runtime overrides.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Claude 4 Sonnet configuration is set with specific temperature and max tokens, **When** a generation request is made, **Then** the model uses these default parameters unless overridden
2. **Given** Titan v2 is configured for 1024-dimension embeddings, **When** embedding requests are made, **Then** the service consistently returns 1024-dimensional vectors
3. **Given** model configurations are updated, **When** new requests are made, **Then** the updated configurations are applied without service restart

---

### User Story 5 - Integration with Consolidated Database Pattern (Priority: P3)

The Bedrock LLM service must integrate seamlessly with the existing consolidated database pattern for vector operations, memory storage, and knowledge base interactions.

**Why this priority**: Consistency with existing architectural patterns ensures maintainability and prevents architectural drift. This builds on the database consolidation work already completed.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by performing operations that involve both LLM calls and database interactions, verifying that the same connection pools and patterns are used consistently.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the consolidated database service is available, **When** the Bedrock service needs to store embeddings, **Then** it uses the existing vector operations service
2. **Given** memory operations are needed, **When** the LLM service retrieves context, **Then** it uses the consolidated memory store instance
3. **Given** knowledge base interactions occur, **When** embeddings are generated for search, **Then** the service integrates with existing knowledge search patterns

### Edge Cases

- What happens when AWS Bedrock experiences regional outages or service degradation?
- How does the system handle token limit exceeded errors for long documents?
- What occurs when Langfuse monitoring service is unavailable?
- How does the service behave when model versions are deprecated or updated by AWS?
- What happens when embedding dimensions don't match expected vector store requirements?
- How does the system handle concurrent requests that exceed AWS rate limits?
