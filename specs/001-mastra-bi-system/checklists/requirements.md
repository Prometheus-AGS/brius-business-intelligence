# Specification Quality Checklist: Mastra Business Intelligence System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 18, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Results**: âœ… PASSED - All checklist items completed successfully

**Content Quality Assessment**:
- Specification focuses on WHAT users need and WHY, not HOW to implement
- Written in business language accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- No mention of specific technologies, frameworks, or implementation approaches
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness Assessment**:
- All 32 functional requirements are testable and specific
- Requirements use clear MUST/SHOULD language
- Success criteria include specific, measurable metrics (e.g., "under 5 minutes", "95% accuracy", "98% success rate")
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic and focus on user outcomes
- Edge cases cover realistic failure scenarios and boundary conditions
- Scope clearly defined through prioritized user stories (P1-P3)
- Dependencies implicitly understood through external system integration requirements

**Feature Readiness Assessment**:
- User stories are prioritized and independently testable
- Each story includes clear acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- P1 story (Intelligent Business Queries) provides standalone MVP value
- Success criteria map directly to user scenarios and functional requirements
- No implementation-specific language used throughout specification

**Ready for Next Phase**: The specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan` - no further refinements needed.
