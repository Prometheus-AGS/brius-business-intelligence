# Tasks: Mastra Business Intelligence System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-mastra-bi-system/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: No test tasks included as tests were not explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS SUMMARY (Updated 2025-01-18)

**Overall Progress**: **95% Complete** - All major features implemented with comprehensive TypeScript architecture

**Phase Status**:
- Phase 1 (Setup): ‚úÖ Complete (5/5 tasks)
- Phase 2 (Foundational): ‚úÖ Complete (9/9 tasks)
- Phase 3 (User Story 1 - Business Queries): ‚úÖ Complete (11/11 tasks)
- Phase 4 (User Story 2 - Memory & Context): ‚úÖ Complete (10/10 tasks)
- Phase 5 (User Story 3 - External Tools): ‚úÖ Complete (10/10 tasks)
- Phase 6 (User Story 4 - Knowledge Base): ‚úÖ Complete (10/10 tasks)
- Phase 7 (User Story 5 - Developer Access): ‚úÖ Complete (11/11 tasks)
- Phase 8 (Polish & Cross-Cutting): ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial (7/8 tasks) - Final testing pending API compatibility

**Task Completion Summary**: 73 of 75 tasks completed (97.3%)

**Key Achievements**:
- 63+ TypeScript files implementing complete system architecture
- Full agent orchestration with intent classification and planning workflows
- Comprehensive knowledge base with document processing and semantic search
- Memory management with user-scoped and global contexts
- MCP client and server implementation for external tool integration
- OpenAI-compatible API endpoints with streaming support
- Docker containerization and deployment configuration
- Vector embeddings with AWS Bedrock Titan v2 integration
- Supabase PostgreSQL database with pgvector for semantic operations
- LangFuse observability and comprehensive tracing
- JWT authentication with optional user context management

**Remaining Work**:
- Update workflow system to Mastra v0.21.1 vNext API (`createStep`/`createWorkflow`)
- Standardize database imports to use `getSupabaseClient()` consistently
- Complete final build validation and testing

**API Compatibility Notes**:
Current implementation uses legacy Mastra workflow API. Migration to vNext required for Mastra v0.21.1 compatibility.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 agents but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Enhances US1 agents but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 planning workflow but independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Exposes all previous stories but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within the same story
- Core implementation before integration with other stories
- Tools and services before API endpoints
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Within each user story, tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch parallel foundational tasks together:
Task: "Create shared type definitions in src/mastra/types/index.ts"
Task: "Implement JWT authentication middleware in src/mastra/auth/jwt.ts"
Task: "Set up LangFuse observability client in src/mastra/observability/langfuse.ts"

# Launch all parallel US1 tasks together:
Task: "Create intent classification workflow in src/mastra/workflows/intent-classifier.ts"
Task: "Implement business intelligence agent in src/mastra/agents/business-intelligence.ts"
Task: "Implement default agent in src/mastra/agents/default.ts"
Task: "Create orchestrator workflow in src/mastra/workflows/orchestrator.ts"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (5 tasks)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (9 tasks) - CRITICAL - blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (11 tasks)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test intelligent business queries independently
5. Deploy/demo core BI functionality

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready (14 tasks)
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo BI queries (MVP - 11 tasks)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo with memory (10 tasks)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo with external tools (10 tasks)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo with knowledge base (10 tasks)
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo full system (11 tasks)
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (14 tasks)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Intelligent Business Queries)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Memory and Context)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (External Tool Integration)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- All agents and workflows MUST be registered in src/mastra/index.ts for playground visibility
- Follow CLAUDE.md requirements: use pnpm, centralize types, validate against Mastra docs
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
