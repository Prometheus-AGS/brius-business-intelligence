# Feature Specification: Mastra Business Intelligence System

**Feature Branch**: `001-mastra-bi-system`
**Created**: October 18, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "implement all functionality described in @docs/README.md"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Intelligent Business Queries (Priority: P1)

Business analysts and executives can ask complex analytical questions in natural language and receive comprehensive, context-aware insights backed by data analysis and knowledge base information.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the system - enabling business stakeholders to get intelligent insights without technical expertise.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by sending natural language business queries (e.g., "Analyze Q4 revenue trends by product category") through the chat interface and receiving structured analytical reports with data visualizations and actionable recommendations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has access to the system, **When** they ask "What factors contributed to the 15% increase in customer churn this quarter?", **Then** the system analyzes multiple data sources, provides a comprehensive report identifying key factors, and offers actionable recommendations
2. **Given** historical data exists in the knowledge base, **When** a user requests "Generate a quarterly performance report", **Then** the system retrieves relevant context, analyzes current data, and produces a formatted report comparing to historical benchmarks
3. **Given** a complex analytical query requiring multiple steps, **When** the user submits the request, **Then** the system creates an execution plan, validates data access, executes the analysis, and synthesizes results into a coherent response

### User Story 2 - Personal Memory and Context (Priority: P2)

Users receive personalized responses based on their historical interactions, preferences, and conversation context, while also benefiting from shared organizational knowledge.

**Why this priority**: Personalization significantly improves user experience and response relevance, making the system more valuable for repeated use.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by having authenticated users interact with the system over multiple sessions, storing preferences and context, then verifying that subsequent responses reflect their personal history and organizational knowledge.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has previously specified reporting preferences, **When** they request a new report, **Then** the system automatically applies their preferred format, metrics, and visualization style
2. **Given** an organization has established policies in global memory, **When** any user asks policy-related questions, **Then** responses incorporate current organizational standards and procedures
3. **Given** a user's conversation history contains relevant context, **When** they ask follow-up questions, **Then** the system maintains context continuity without requiring repetition

---

### User Story 3 - External Tool Integration (Priority: P2)

Users can leverage external systems and data sources through a unified interface, accessing tools like Supabase databases, GitHub repositories, and file systems without switching contexts.

**Why this priority**: Integration capabilities make the system a comprehensive hub for business operations rather than an isolated tool.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by configuring MCP servers for different external systems and verifying that users can query databases, create issues, read files, and perform other operations seamlessly through natural language commands.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Supabase and GitHub MCP servers are configured, **When** a user asks "Show me recent customer orders and create a GitHub issue for any anomalies", **Then** the system queries the database, analyzes results, and creates GitHub issues as needed
2. **Given** filesystem access is configured, **When** a user requests "Read the latest sales report and summarize key findings", **Then** the system accesses the file, processes content, and provides a structured summary
3. **Given** multiple data sources are available, **When** users ask cross-system questions, **Then** the system intelligently routes requests to appropriate tools and correlates results

---

### User Story 4 - Knowledge Base Management (Priority: P3)

Users can upload, organize, and search through organizational documents, reports, and knowledge assets to inform decision-making and provide context for analytical queries.

**Why this priority**: While important for context, the system can function with external data sources initially, making this enhancement rather than core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by uploading various document types (PDF, DOCX, TXT), performing semantic searches, and verifying that document content is incorporated into analytical responses.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** users have permissions to manage documents, **When** they upload quarterly reports and policy documents, **Then** the system processes, indexes, and makes content searchable for future queries
2. **Given** a comprehensive knowledge base exists, **When** users ask analytical questions, **Then** the system references relevant documents to provide context-aware responses
3. **Given** documents contain sensitive information, **When** users access content, **Then** appropriate access controls ensure only authorized users can retrieve specific documents

---

### User Story 5 - Developer and Administrator Access (Priority: P3)

Technical teams can configure, monitor, and extend the system through playground interfaces, observability tools, and API access for integration with existing business systems.

**Why this priority**: Administrative capabilities are essential for maintenance but not for core user value delivery.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by accessing the playground interface to view and test available tools, monitoring system performance through LangFuse integration, and using OpenAI-compatible APIs for custom integrations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** administrator access to the playground, **When** new tools are added, **Then** they are automatically registered and available for testing and documentation
2. **Given** LangFuse integration is active, **When** users interact with the system, **Then** all conversations, tool calls, and performance metrics are logged with user attribution for analysis
3. **Given** OpenAI-compatible APIs are exposed, **When** external systems integrate, **Then** they can access agents and workflows using standard API patterns

### Edge Cases

- What happens when multiple complex queries are submitted simultaneously by different users?
- How does the system handle incomplete or ambiguous natural language queries?
- What occurs when external MCP servers become unavailable during query processing?
- How does the system respond when knowledge base searches return no relevant results?
- What happens when user memory storage reaches capacity limits?
- How does the system handle queries that require data from multiple sources with conflicting information?
- What occurs when AI model APIs experience rate limiting or temporary outages?
