# Feature Specification: Constitutional Compliance Fixes

**Feature Branch**: `002-fix-constitutional-violations`
**Created**: 2025-01-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "update specification to fix critical constitutional violations: replace Supabase database with pgvector 17, add comprehensive LangFuse tracing, implement Supabase MCP server integration, and validate against latest Mastra APIs"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Database Architecture Compliance (Priority: P1)

Development teams must use pgvector 17 database with postgres functions for all vector storage and semantic search operations, ensuring constitutional compliance and proper business intelligence functionality.

**Why this priority**: This is a NON-NEGOTIABLE constitutional requirement that blocks all other development until resolved.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying database connections use pgvector 17, all vector operations use postgres functions called via pg npm module or drizzle/drizzlekit, and no Supabase database dependencies exist in the codebase.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the system needs vector storage capabilities, **When** database operations are performed, **Then** they use pgvector 17 database with proper postgres function calls
2. **Given** semantic search functionality is required, **When** vector operations execute, **Then** they utilize postgres functions through pg module or drizzle/drizzlekit interfaces
3. **Given** constitutional compliance is verified, **When** database architecture is reviewed, **Then** no Supabase database dependencies exist in the system

### User Story 2 - Comprehensive Observability Integration (Priority: P1)

Development teams and operations personnel can monitor all system interactions, tool calls, agent executions, and workflow processes through comprehensive LangFuse tracing that captures requests, results, and errors.

**Why this priority**: Constitutional requirement for business intelligence operations monitoring, debugging, and performance analysis.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by executing various system operations and verifying that all tool calls, agent interactions, workflow executions, requests, results, and errors are properly traced and logged in LangFuse.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an agent processes a user request, **When** the interaction occurs, **Then** all tool calls including requests, results, and errors are traced in LangFuse
2. **Given** a workflow executes multiple steps, **When** the workflow runs, **Then** each step's execution, performance metrics, and outcomes are logged with user attribution
3. **Given** system errors occur during operations, **When** failures happen, **Then** comprehensive error details and context are captured in LangFuse for debugging

---

### User Story 3 - MCP Server Integration (Priority: P2)

Users and external systems can seamlessly access Supabase functionality through the built-in MCP server capabilities, enabling proper Model Context Protocol integration as mandated by constitutional requirements.

**Why this priority**: Constitutional requirement for MCP integration using built-in Supabase capabilities.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by configuring the Supabase MCP server using built-in capabilities and verifying external systems can successfully connect and execute operations through the MCP protocol.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Supabase MCP server is configured using built-in capabilities, **When** external MCP clients connect, **Then** they can successfully access Supabase functionality through proper protocol handlers
2. **Given** MCP client requests are received, **When** operations are executed, **Then** appropriate error handling and configuration management ensure reliable service
3. **Given** multiple MCP clients access the system, **When** concurrent operations occur, **Then** proper protocol compliance maintains system stability

---

### User Story 4 - API Validation and Compliance (Priority: P2)

Development teams can validate all Mastra framework usage against the latest APIs using available MCP servers (mastra mcp server, context7 mcp server) to ensure constitutional compliance and prevent API compatibility issues.

**Why this priority**: Constitutional requirement to validate against latest Mastra APIs prevents implementation failures.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running validation checks against Mastra MCP docs server and context7 MCP server, confirming all framework usage follows current best practices and API specifications.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** code uses Mastra framework features, **When** validation runs against latest APIs, **Then** all usage patterns conform to current specifications and best practices
2. **Given** workflow and agent implementations exist, **When** API compliance is checked, **Then** all Mastra components follow documented patterns and registration requirements
3. **Given** external MCP servers are available for validation, **When** code quality checks execute, **Then** comprehensive validation confirms constitutional compliance

### Edge Cases

- What happens when pgvector 17 database is unavailable during system startup?
- How does the system handle LangFuse tracing failures without breaking core functionality?
- What occurs when Supabase MCP server configuration is invalid or incomplete?
- How does the system respond when API validation against MCP servers fails during development?
- What happens when postgres functions encounter version compatibility issues?
- How does the system handle concurrent database operations with complex vector queries?
