## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (P1): Database compliance - can start after Foundational
  - User Story 2 (P1): Observability - can start after Foundational
  - User Story 3 (P2): MCP Integration - should start after User Story 2 (for tracing integration)
  - User Story 4 (P2): API Validation - should start after User Story 3 (needs MCP clients)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Benefits from User Story 2 completion for tracing integration (T054)
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Requires User Story 3 completion for MCP client access (T073)

### Within Each User Story

- Database schema before service implementation
- Core services before API endpoints
- Integration tasks after individual component completion
- Health checks and validation after functional implementation

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup Phase**: All tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- **Foundational Phase**: Tasks T006, T007, T008 can run in parallel after T005
- **User Story 1**: Database schema tasks (T011-T014) can run in parallel
- **User Story 2**: Infrastructure tasks (T028-T031) and API endpoints (T037-T041) can run in parallel
- **User Story 3**: Configuration tasks (T046-T049) and API endpoints (T050-T053) can run in parallel
- **User Story 4**: Validation services (T062-T065) can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all database schema tasks together:
Task: "Create user_memories table schema with vector embedding column in src/mastra/database/schema.ts"
Task: "Create global_memories table schema with access control in src/mastra/database/schema.ts"
Task: "Create knowledge_documents table schema with file metadata in src/mastra/database/schema.ts"
Task: "Create document_chunks table schema with vector embeddings in src/mastra/database/schema.ts"

# Launch all service layer implementations together (after schema):
Task: "Replace memory storage implementation to use pgvector functions in src/mastra/memory/storage.ts"
Task: "Replace knowledge search implementation to use pgvector functions in src/mastra/knowledge/search.ts"
Task: "Update embedding service to work with pgvector storage in src/mastra/memory/embeddings.ts"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 - Both P1 Priority)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Database Architecture Compliance)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Comprehensive Observability)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test both user stories independently
6. Deploy/demo constitutional compliance foundation

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Database compliance!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Full observability!)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MCP integration!)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Complete compliance!)
6. Each story adds constitutional compliance without breaking previous functionality

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Database Architecture)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Observability)
3. After User Stories 1 & 2 complete:
   - Developer A: User Story 3 (MCP Integration)
   - Developer B: User Story 4 (API Validation)
4. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for constitutional compliance traceability
- Each user story addresses a specific constitutional violation
- User Stories 1 & 2 are both P1 priority and can be developed in parallel
- User Stories 3 & 4 are P2 priority with dependencies on earlier stories
- Constitutional compliance validation occurs throughout implementation
- All tasks maintain feature-based clean architecture as required by constitution
- Avoid: breaking existing functionality, creating duplicate code, violating architectural principles

**Total Tasks**: 83 tasks across 4 user stories
**Parallel Opportunities**: 25 tasks can run in parallel within their phases
**MVP Scope**: User Stories 1 & 2 (Database Architecture + Observability) = 45 tasks
**Constitutional Compliance**: All tasks directly address identified constitutional violations
